        <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hello I'm a programmer with 2 years of work experience in the field. 
        I've also graduated from Mendelova Střední Škola (information technology) and Ostravská univerzita (applied infromation technology) with a bachelors degree.
        I've played computer games almost my whole life and am very interested in how they are made.
        My favourite games are Dark Souls, Minecraft and The Binding of Isaac.
