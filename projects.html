        <p>
        JETI Studio is a cross-platform program for the visualization and analysis of telemetry data received from sensors from the company JETI Model.
        My part of this project was mainly the chart window and general debugging.

        <p>
        In this unity game you control a car with WASD and try to race the AI driver to the finish line.
        There are also speed and slow down zones.
        I've developed this game for 2 of my university courses, one was game development and the other was AI.

        This python project solves the game minesweeper with the most optimal moves.
        Where there are no 100% moves it chooses the tile with the least bomb probability.

        This is my first attempt on game development in unity. 
        It's a third person shooter where you collect coins to win.
        There are destroyable red cubes, and also a purple block which takes away your jumping ablility.
