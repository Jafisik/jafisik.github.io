        <p>
        JETI Studio is a cross-platform program for the visualization and analysis of telemetry data received from sensors from the company JETI Model.
        My part of this project was mainly the chart window and general debugging.

        In this game you control a car and try to race the AI driver to the finish line.
        I've developed this game for 2 of my university courses, one was game development and the other was AI.

        This is my first attempt on game development in unity. It's a third person shooter where you collect coins to win.
